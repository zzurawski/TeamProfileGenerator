##User Story
As a user, I want to create a hub that contains contact info of my team.

## Description
Using inquirer and jest, the user will be prompted questions to input the specific info of an employee. Different roles of the employee will prompt more unique questions that relate to the employee's role. Once the back-end questions are all answered and validated, the employees' contact cards will show on the front-end with all the necessary information.

## How to Run 
Using npm install, the user will have to acquire inquirer and jest. From the terminal, the user invokes the node for the 'index.js' file. The console will prompt questions in the terminal which the user answers accordingly. If role-specific questions are null, the program will act properly to place te employee in the correct role.
